This files in this folder contain code to compute quadratic points on X_0(N) for certain levels N not considered in the paper.
Any output files are also in this folder.

We note that the computations have not been verified with the same level of rigour as those appearing in the paper, and we do not necessarily diplay all the steps necessary to provably determine the quadratic points (for example, we might not compute the rational points on a given quotient curve).
Despite this, we hope that the computations may be of use to people who wish to compute quadratic points on certain curves X_0(N).
