This folder contains code to compute quadratic points on X_0(N) for certain levels N not considered in the paper.

We note that the computations have not been verified with the same level of rigour as those appearing in the paper.
However, we hope that they may be of use to people who wish to compute quadratic points on certain curves X_0(N).
