# QuadraticPoints
Magma code to compute quadratic points on X_0(N)

The repository consists of the following files (please add files and update the brief descriptions appropriately):

- goingdown_j_points. This file contains a function to compute the coordinates of points on a model of X_0(N) with a given j-invariant and over a given quadratic field. It is mainly used for producing the data for the "going down" method.
- new_models.m.  This file contains code to compute models for X_0(N), quotient curves, quotient maps, j-maps and more.
- pullbacks.m.   This file contains a function to search for quadratic points on a model of X_0(N) arising as pullbacks of rational points on a quotient.
