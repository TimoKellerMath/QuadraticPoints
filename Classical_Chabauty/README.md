The code in this folder is for using Classical Chabauty to compute rational points.

The file `74_37.m` contains the computations and output file of rational points for X_0(74)/w_37. The file `74_37.out` contains the corresponding output file.

The file `model_equation_finder.m` is from https://github.com/AWS2020QC/ModularCurvesX0plusG4-6, and associated to the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04811

The remaining files are taken from https://github.com/jtuitman/Coleman.
This is the Magma code of Balakrishnan and Tuitman to perform Chabauty computations for rational points.
