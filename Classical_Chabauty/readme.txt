The code in this folder is for using Classical Chabauty to compute rational points.

The files 74_37.m, 86_43.m, and the .out files contain the computations of rational points for X_0(74)/w_37 and X_0(86)/w_43

// The file model model_equation_finder is from https://github.com/AWS2020QC/ModularCurvesX0plusG4-6, and associated to the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04811

The remaining files are taken from https://github.com/jtuitman/Cartan13/tree/master/Coleman-1.3.
This is the Magma code of Balakrishnan and Tuitman to perform Chavauty computations for rational points.
